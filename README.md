## What is SaferPlace

SaferPlace is a platform created to report incidents which happen in the area.
So often there are crimes and violations in your surrounding which are not
reported. Originally designed to tell you which areas are safe to live in for
college based on the Gardaí crime report data, we are now expanding the idea by
letting you report safety infractions.

The project is currently in **heavy** development, but if you would like to see
what we are currently working on, take a look at our [Project Milestones] and
[Project Backlog]

The current plan is to have the site fully functional by the end of 2023 with
the website being available at [https://safer.place]

## Old Code

- If you would like to see the original implementation of SaferPlace, take a
  look at [Original SaferPlace].
- There was an attempt at rewriting the original codebase, but that attempt was
  then replaced by “realtime SaferPlace” (community sourced, this repository).
  If you would like to see it, the efforts are kept on the
  [saferplace-v1 Branch]
